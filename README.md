# Probability and Statistics â€“ Course Summary
This repository contains my solved exercises, lab assignments, and exam preparations for the Probability and Statistics course. The focus was on applying core statistical concepts both theoretically and through practical problem solving using Python.

## Course Overview
The course covered fundamental principles of probability theory and statistics, including:

- Descriptive Statistics: mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation

- Probability Basics: combinatorics, probability spaces, conditional probability

- Discrete Distributions: Binomial, Geometric, Poisson distributions

- Continuous Distributions: Uniform, Exponential, Normal distributions

- Hypothesis Testing:

  - One-sample and two-sample tests

  - Parametric (t-test) and non-parametric (Wilcoxon, Mann-Whitney) tests

- Confidence Intervals and p-values

- Chi-Square Tests for independence and goodness of fit

## Skills and Practice
- Solved both manual calculations and programming tasks using Python (NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib)

- Worked through typical statistical scenarios such as survey analysis, data sampling, and inference

- Practiced plotting and visualization of probability distributions

- Applied random sampling and Monte Carlo simulations

- Gained practical experience in writing clean, reusable scripts for statistical analysis
